                    <p>Following his short playing time in Monaco, Sofiane Diop crosses a pass where he is no longer where he is and questions his career.</p>
                    <p>During the 2019 summer mercato, Sofiane knows a loan to Angers cancelled at the last one and thus still finds itself with the reserve of Monaco with a small playing time at the end of the mercato.</p>
                    <p>Then a last hope opens to him with the possibility to join Sochaux as a medical joker, proposal that he will accept right away.</p>
                    <p>He thus made the 2019-2020 season in Sochaux in order to revive and regain playing time.</p>
